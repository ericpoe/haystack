## [2.1.0](https://github.com/ericpoe/haystack/tree/v2.1.0) - 2019-01-17

### Added
* Now with UTF-8 strings!
* Added support for PHP 7.1 - 7.3

### Removed
* Removed support for PHP 5.5 since it doesn't support UTF-8 as well as I'd like

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/ericpoe/haystack/tree/v2.0.0) - 2016-12-08

### Changed
* BC Break: ::locate($value) now throws an ElementNotFoundException when looking for something that does not exist
* BC Break: HString classes now use a protected property of `$hString` if they're an `HString` and `$str` if they're a `String` since `string` is a reserved word in PHP7
* BC Break: HString ::toHArray() now assumes an empty-string delimiter. ::toHArray() is now *mostly* an alias to `explode`. This means that the default string-array will be made of characters, not words.
  * This affects HString::toArray() in that it will now create an array of characters rather than words
* Potential BC Break: HArray can now contain objects. So `new HArray(new \DateTime())` is now possible!
* Clean up HString methods
* Whitespace rules added for md, yml, and json files
* **Manual**
    * Some examples were changed to show an alternative manner of declaring the Haystack object for use in pipelining (thanks for the heads-up, @ajmichels!)
    * Made `toArray` work for both HArray and HString

### Fixed
* HArray::remove() no longer makes the entire array have numeric keys if the removed key was numeric
* HArray::toArray() was sometimes returning an \ArrayObject. Now it just returns an array

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/ericpoe/haystack/tree/v1.0.2) - 2016-03-01

### Fixed
* Bugfix: internal storage when generating an HArray from an HString
* Bugfix: Extended HArray and HString classes can also be pipelined

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/ericpoe/haystack/tree/v1.0.1) - 2016-02-16

### Changed
* Minor performance boost to HString::contains

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/ericpoe/haystack/tree/v1.0.0) - 2016-02-15

    * Move Pipelining section to be closer to the top since it's a good example of what can be done
    * Add OArray- & OString- specific sections

### Changed
